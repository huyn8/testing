Article 84

If any disagreement between two or more contracting States relating to the interpretation or application of this Convention and its Annexes cannot be settled by negotiation, it shall, on the application of any State concerned in the disagreement, be decided by the Council. No member of the Council shall vote in the consideration by the Council of any dispute to which it is a party. Any contracting State may, subject to Article 85, appeal from the decision of the Council to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal agreed upon with the other parties to the dispute or to the Permanent Court of International Justice. Any such appeal shall be notified to the Council within sixty days of receipt of notification of the decision of the Council.

Article 85

Arbitration procedure

If any contracting State party to a dispute in which the decision of the Council is under appeal has not accepted the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice and the contracting States parties to the dispute cannot agree on the choice of the arbitral tribunal, each of the contracting States parties


No.  102

354	United Nations — Treaty Series	1948


to the dispute shall name a single arbitrator who shall name an umpire. If either contracting State party to the dispute fails to name an arbitrator within a period of three months from the date of the appeal, an arbitrator shall be named on behalf of that State by the President of the Council from a list of qualified and available persons maintained by the Council. If, within thirty days, the arbi trators cannot agree on an umpire, the President of the Council shall designate an umpire from the list previously referred to. The arbitrators and the umpire shall then jointly constitute an arbitral tribunal. Any arbitral tribunal established under this or the preceding Article shall settle its own procedure and give its decisions by majority vote, provided that the Council may determine procedural questions in the event of any delay which in the opinion of the Council is excessive.



Article 86

Appeals

Unless the Council decides otherwise, any decision by the Council on whether an international airline is operating in conformity with the provisions of this Convention shall remain in effect unless reversed on appeal. On any other matter, decisions of the Council shall, if appealed from, be suspended until the appeal is decided. The decisions of the Permanent Court of Inter national Justice and of an arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding.

*The Convention was signed in the English original version formulated at the International Civil Aviation Conference which took place at Chicago from 1 November to 7 December 1944. No trilingual text has been opened for signature as provided for in the Convention.

The Government of the United States of America in the note of the State Department of 22 September 1947 addressed to the Chiefs of Mission of the Governments concerned, after having drawn their attention to the various problems involved in this respect and to the fact that the Convention as drawn up at the Chicago Conference did not place a specific responsi bility upon the United States Government, as depository of the Convention, to prepare the trilingual text, concluded: ""The Department of State considers that it is not advisable to proceed at this time with preparations to open for signature at Washington trilingual texts of those documents. On the contrary, the United States Government proposes to present the question to the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization with a request that the question be placed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Assembly of that Organiza tion. It is believed that this procedure will afford the most efficacious means by which the governments concerned may, after due consideration of all the factors and problems involved, make such decisions with respect thereto as they deem appropriate.""

The French translation of the Convention as it appears in the Treaty Series has been made by the Secretariat.

CUSTOMS  TARIFFS-JULY  5,  1890	li3

ART. 2. The object of the Union is to publish, at the common expense, and to make known, as speedily and accurately as possible, the customs tariffs of the various States of the globe and the modifications that may, in future, be made in those tariffs.

ART. 3. To this end, an International Bureau shall be organized at Brus-sels, whose duty it shall be to cause these tariffs, together with such legisla-tive or executive provisions as may introduce modifications therein, to be translated and published.

ART. 4. This publication shall be made in a collection entitled: ""Inter-national Customs Bulletin (organ of the International Union for the publica-tion of Customs Tariffs)."" The Commercial languages most in use shall be adopted for this purpose.

ART. 5. The persons composing the International Bureau shall be ap-pointed through the agency of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belgium, which shall advance the necessary funds and see that the institution is properly managed.

ART. 6. In communications addressed by the International Bureau to the adhering Governments, the French language shall be used.

ART. 7. A report concerning the labors and the financial condition of the International Bureau shall be annually addressed to the adhering Govern-ments.

ART. 8. The annual budget of the expenditures of the International Bureau shall be fixed at the maximum of 125,000 francs.

The sum of 50,000 francs shall be placed, the first year, at the disposal of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium, to enable him to meet the expenses of the organization of the Bureau.

Such States and colonies as may hereafter avail themselves of the privilege of adhering, for which provision is made in article 14, shall pay their quotas of the said sum of 50,000 francs, on the basis of apportionment fixed in article 9.

States and colonies withdrawing from the Union at the expiration of the first term of seven years shall forfeit their rights as joint owners of the common fund.

In case of a liquidation, the common fund shall be divided among the States and colonies forming the Union on the basis of apportionment fixed by article 9.

ART. 9. With a view to the equitable adjustment of the quotas of the contracting States, those States shall be divided, according to the amount of their commerce, into six classes, the quota payable by each of which shall be in the proportion of a certain number of units, to wit:

1st class. Countries whose commerce regularly amounts to upwards of four thousand millions of francs: 55 units.

2nd class. Countries whose commerce regularly amounts to from two to four thousand millions of francs: 40 units.

174	MULTILATERAL  AGREEMENTS,	1776-1917

3d class. Countries whose commerce regularly amounts to from five hundred millions to two thousand millions of francs: 25 units.

4th class. Countries whose commerce regularly amounts to from one hundred to five hundred millions of francs: 20 units.

5th class. Countries whose commerce regularly amounts to from fifty to one hundred millions offrancs: 15 units.

6th class. Countries whose commerce regularly amounts to less than 50 millions of francs: 5 units.

ART. 10. In the case of countries whose language is not used by the Inter-national Bureau, the above figures shall be reduced two-fifths, respectively. The following reductions shall therefore be made:

The quota of the first class shall be reduced to 33 units.

The quota of the second class shall be reduced to 24 units.
The quota of the third class shall be reduced to 15 units.

The quota of the fourth class shall be reduced to 12 units.
The quota of the fifth class shall be reduced to 9 units.
The quota of the sixth class shall be reduced to 3 units.

ART. 11. The sum total of the annual expenditure, divided by the sum of the units assigned to the various contracting States, in pursuance of the foregoing provisions, shall give the unit of expenditure. This unit, multiplied by the number of units assigned to each of these States, shall show the amount of the quota payable by it for the support of the International Bureau.

ART. 12. In order to enable the Institution to edit the International Cus-toms Bulletin as accurately as possible, the contracting parties shall send it, directly and without delay, two copies:

(a)of their customs law and their customs tariff, carefully brought up to

date.

( b)  of all provisions that shall ultimately modify said law and tariff.

(c) of the circulars and instructions that shall be addressed by the said Governments to their custom-houses concerning the application of the tariff or the classification of goods, and that can be made public.

(d)of their treaties of commerce, international conventions and domestic laws having a direct bearing upon the existing tariffs.

ART. 13.

ART. 14. The States and colonies that have not yet taken part in this con-vention shall have the privilege of acceding thereto hereafter.

Notice of accession shall be given, in writing, to the Belgian Government, which shall, in tum, commmunicate such notice to all the other contracting Governments. Accession shall imply adhesion to all the clauses contained in, and the enjoyment of all advantages provided for by, this convention.

ART. 15. This convention shall go into operation on the first day of April 1891, and shall remain in force for seven years.

If, twelve months before the expiration of the first seven years, no notice of a desire for the cessation of the effects of this convention shall have been given, the Union shall continue to exist for seven years longer, and so on, in periods of seven years each.

Notice of a desire for the cessation of the effects of this convention shall be addressed to the Belgian Government. Such notice shall have no effect save as regards the country giving it, and the convention shall remain in force so far as the other countries of the Union are concerned.

The Governments shall at all times be at liberty to make in this conven-tion, by mutual agreement, such improvements as may be deemed expedient or necessary.

In testimony whereof, the undersigned have signed this Convention, and have thereunto affixed their seals.

REGULATIONS  FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE CONVENTION CREATING AN IN-TERNATIONAL BUREAU FOR THE PUBLICATION OF CUSTOMS TARIFFS

(Article  13  of the  Convention)

ARTICLE 1st. The international Customs Bulletin shall be published in five languages, with German, English,Spanish, French and Italian.

ART. 2. Each State belonging to the Union shall have the privilege of causing to be translated and publishing at its own expense, the whole or any part of the Bulletin in any language that it may see fit, provided that such language be not one of those adopted by the International Bureau.

Each of the States of the Union shall likewise have the right to reproduce mere extracts from tariffs, or, by way of exception, portions of the Bulletin, either in a local official organ or in its parliamentary documents.

It is understood moreover, that each State is to be at liberty, as has hitherto been the case, to publish all the tariffs in the original language or in a trans-lation, provided that the text published be not the work of the International Bureau.

ART. 3. The International Bureau pledges itself to take the utmost care in the translation of the customs laws and of the official publications that serve to interpret said laws, but it is understood that the Governments interested assume no responsibility with regard to the accuracy of these translations, and that, in case of dispute, the original text shall be their sole guide.

Anotice to this effect shall be printed in large type at the foot of the first page of each number.

ART. 4.  The size of the Bulletin shall be determined by the Bureau.

ART. 5. Each Government shall make known in which of the languages adopted by the International Bureau it desires to receive the copies of the Bulletin which are to be furnished to it in return for the amount payable by it for the support of the institution.

CUSTOMS  TARIFFS-JULY  5,  1890
177

Any government may take a certain number of copies in one language, and the remainder in other languages.

ART. 6. The International Bureau can supply the Bulletin to, no Govern-ments save those belonging to the Union.

ART. 7. The amount of the quota payable by each State shall be returned to it in subscriptions to the Bulletin of the Union, computed at the rate of 15
francs each.	'

ART. 8.  The expenditures are computed approximately as follows:

Francs
(a)Salaries of the offil;ers and employes of the International Bureau, including
an addition thereto of  15 per cent, "" . , .. , , . , , , , , , , , , , .... , , ,

, , . , . , ,
75,000
(b)  Cost of printing and sending the  Bulletin of the Union, . , , , ,
,

30, 000
(c)Rent and keeping  in  order of the  building occupied  by  the  International
Bureau,  fuel,  light,  material,  office  expenses,  etc, .. """" . """",
, . ""....   20, 000
Total' ,., .. ,
,.""  .'""""
,
125,000

ART. 9., Itshall be the duty of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium to take such measures as may be necessary for ~he organization of the Inter-national Bureau, and for putting it in working order, keeping within the limits fixed by the Convention and by these regulations.

ART. 10. The Superintendent of the International Bureau is hereby au-thorized, subject to the approval of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bel-gium, to use, during the current fiscal year, such sums, appropriated for the past year, as may not have been then used. These sums shall, the case arising, go to form a reserve fund for the payment of contingent expenses. The said reserve shall in no case exceed 25,000 francs. The surplus will, perhaps, render it possible to reduce the price of subscription to the Bulletin, without increasing the number of copies guaranteed by the contracting States; this surplus may also serve to meet the expense that would be occasioned by the addition of a new language to those enumerated in article 1.

This last measure shall not be carried out without the unanimous consent of the States and Colonies belonging to the Union.

Done at Brussels, July the 5th, one thousand eight hundred arid ninety, to be appended to the Convention of this day's date.

The countries of the Union, being equally animated by the desire to protect, in as effective and uniform a manner as possible, the rights of authors in their literary and artistic works,

Recognizing the importance of the work of the Revision Conference held at Stockholm in 1967,

Have resolved to revise the Act adopted by the Stockholm Conference, while maintaining without change Articles 1 to 20 and 22 to 26 of that Act.

Consequently, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries, having presented their full powers, recognized as in good and due form, have agreed as follows:

Article 1

[Establishment of a Union]1

The countries to which this Convention applies constitute a Union for the protection of the rights of authors in their literary and artistic works.

Article 2

[Protected Works: 1. “Literary and artistic works”; 2. Possible requirement of fixation; 3. Derivative works;

4.Official texts; 5. Collections; 6. Obligation to protect; beneficiaries of protection; 7. Works of applied art and industrial designs; 8. News]

(1)The expression “literary and artistic works” shall include every production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression, such as books, pamphlets and other writings; lectures, addresses, sermons and other works of the same nature; dramatic or dramatico-musical works; choreographic works and entertainments in dumb show; musical compositions with or without words; cinematographic works to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; works of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving and lithography; photographic works to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; works of applied art; illustrations, maps, plans, sketches and three-dimensional works relative to geography, topography, architecture or science.

(2)It shall, however, be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works shall not be protected unless they have been fixed in some material form.

(3)Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and other alterations of a literary or artistic work shall be protected as original works without prejudice to the copyright in the original work.

(4)It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the protection to be granted to official texts of a legislative, administrative and legal nature, and to official translations of such texts.

(5)Collections of literary or artistic works such as encyclopaedias and anthologies which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such, without prejudice to the copyright in each of the works forming part of such collections.


1Each Article and the Appendix have been given titles to facilitate their identification.  There are no titles in the signed (English)

text.





page 4 / 29

(6)The works mentioned in this Article shall enjoy protection in all countries of the Union. This protection shall operate for the benefit of the author and his successors in title.

(7)Subject to the provisions of Article 7(4) of this Convention, it shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the extent of the application of their laws to works of applied art and industrial designs and models, as well as the conditions under which such works, designs and models shall be protected. Works protected in the country of origin solely as designs and models shall be entitled in another country of the Union only to such special protection as is granted in that country to designs and models; however, if no such special protection is granted in that country, such works shall be protected as artistic works.

(8)The protection of this Convention shall not apply to news of the day or to miscellaneous facts having the character of mere items of press information.

Article 2bis

[Possible Limitation of Protection of Certain Works: 1. Certain speeches; 2. Certain uses of lectures and addresses; 3. Right to make collections of such works]

(1)It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to exclude, wholly or in part, from the protection provided by the preceding Article political speeches and speeches delivered in the course of legal proceedings.

(2)It shall also be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the conditions under which lectures, addresses and other works of the same nature which are delivered in public may be reproduced by the press, broadcast, communicated to the public by wire and made the subject of public communication as envisaged in Article 11bis(1) of this Convention, when such use is justified by the informatory purpose.

(3)Nevertheless, the author shall enjoy the exclusive right of making a collection of his works mentioned in the preceding paragraphs.

Article 3

[Criteria of Eligibility for Protection: 1. Nationality of author; place of publication of work; 2. Residence of author; 3. “Published” works; 4. “Simultaneously published” works]

(1)The protection of this Convention shall apply to:

(a)authors who are nationals of one of the countries of the Union, for their works, whether published or not;

(b)authors who are not nationals of one of the countries of the Union, for their works first published in one of those countries, or simultaneously in a country outside the Union and in a country of the Union.

(2)Authors who are not nationals of one of the countries of the Union but who have their habitual residence in one of them shall, for the purposes of this Convention, be assimilated to nationals of that country.

(3)The expression “published works” means works published with the consent of their authors, whatever may be the means of manufacture of the copies, provided that the availability of such copies has been such as to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the public, having regard to the nature of the work. The performance of a dramatic, dramatico-musical, cinematographic or musical work, the public recitation of a literary work, the communication by wire or the broadcasting of literary or artistic works, the exhibition of a work of art and the construction of a work of architecture shall not constitute publication.

(4)A work shall be considered as having been published simultaneously in several countries if it has been published in two or more countries within thirty days of its first publication.










page 5 / 29

Article 4

[Criteria of Eligibility for Protection of Cinematographic Works, Works of Architecture and Certain Artistic Works]

The protection of this Convention shall apply, even if the conditions of Article 3 are not fulfilled, to:

(a)authors of cinematographic works the maker of which has his headquarters or habitual residence in one of the countries of the Union;

(b)authors of works of architecture erected in a country of the Union or of other artistic works incorporated in a building or other structure located in a country of the Union.

Article 5

[Rights Guaranteed: 1. and 2. Outside the country of origin; 3. In the country of origin; 4. “Country of origin”]

(1)Authors shall enjoy, in respect of works for which they are protected under this Convention, in countries of the Union other than the country of origin, the rights which their respective laws do now or may hereafter grant to their nationals, as well as the rights specially granted by this Convention.

(2)The enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be subject to any formality; such enjoyment and such exercise shall be independent of the existence of protection in the country of origin of the work. Consequently, apart from the provisions of this Convention, the extent of protection, as well as the means of redress afforded to the author to protect his rights, shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the country where protection is claimed.

(3)Protection in the country of origin is governed by domestic law. However, when the author is not a national of the country of origin of the work for which he is protected under this Convention, he shall enjoy in that country the same rights as national authors.

(4)The country of origin shall be considered to be:

(a)in the case of works first published in a country of the Union, that country; in the case of works published simultaneously in several countries of the Union which grant different terms of protection, the country whose legislation grants the shortest term of protection;

(b)in the case of works published simultaneously in a country outside the Union and in a country of the Union, the latter country;

(c)in the case of unpublished works or of works first published in a country outside the Union, without simultaneous publication in a country of the Union, the country of the Union of which the author is a national, provided that:

(i)when these are cinematographic works the maker of which has his headquarters or his habitual residence in a country of the Union, the country of origin shall be that country, and

(ii)when these are works of architecture erected in a country of the Union or other artistic works incorporated in a building or other structure located in a country of the Union, the country of origin shall be that country.

Article 6

[Possible Restriction of Protection in Respect of Certain Works of Nationals of Certain Countries Outside the Union: 1. In the country of the first publication and in other countries; 2. No retroactivity; 3. Notice]

(1)Where any country outside the Union fails to protect in an adequate manner the works of authors who are nationals of one of the countries of the Union, the latter country may restrict the protection given to the works of authors who are, at the date of the first publication thereof, nationals of the other country and are not habitually resident in one of the countries of the Union. If the country of first publication avails itself of this right, the other countries of the Union shall not be required to grant to works thus subjected to special treatment a wider protection than that granted to them in the country of first publication.





page 6 / 29

(2)No restrictions introduced by virtue of the preceding paragraph shall affect the rights which an author may have acquired in respect of a work published in a country of the Union before such restrictions were put into force.

(3)The countries of the Union which restrict the grant of copyright in accordance with this Article shall give notice thereof to the Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (hereinafter designated as “the Director General”) by a written declaration specifying the countries in regard to which protection is restricted, and the restrictions to which rights of authors who are nationals of those countries are subjected. The Director General shall immediately communicate this declaration to all the countries of the Union.

Article 6bis

[Moral Rights: 1. To claim authorship; to object to certain modifications and other derogatory actions; 2. After the author’s death; 3. Means of redress]

(1)Independently of the author’s economic rights, and even after the transfer of the said rights, the author shall have the right to claim authorship of the work and to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to, the said work, which would be prejudicial to his honor or reputation.

(2)The rights granted to the author in accordance with the preceding paragraph shall, after his death, be maintained, at least until the expiry of the economic rights, and shall be exercisable by the persons or institutions authorized by the legislation of the country where protection is claimed. However, those countries whose legislation, at the moment of their ratification of or accession to this Act, does not provide for the protection after the death of the author of all the rights set out in the preceding paragraph may provide that some of these rights may, after his death, cease to be maintained.

(3)The means of redress for safeguarding the rights granted by this Article shall be governed by the legislation of the country where protection is claimed.

Article 7

[Term of Protection: 1. Generally; 2. For cinematographic works; 3. For anonymous and pseudonymous works; 4. For photographic works and works of applied art; 5. Starting date of computation; 6. Longer terms; 7. Shorter terms; 8. Applicable law; “comparison” of terms]

(1)The term of protection granted by this Convention shall be the life of the author and fifty years after his death.

(2)However, in the case of cinematographic works, the countries of the Union may provide that the term of protection shall expire fifty years after the work has been made available to the public with the consent of the author, or, failing such an event within fifty years from the making of such a work, fifty years after the making.

(3)In the case of anonymous or pseudonymous works, the term of protection granted by this Convention shall expire fifty years after the work has been lawfully made available to the public. However, when the pseudonym adopted by the author leaves no doubt as to his identity, the term of protection shall be that provided in paragraph (1). If the author of an anonymous or pseudonymous work discloses his identity during the above-mentioned period, the term of protection applicable shall be that provided in paragraph (1). The countries of the Union shall not be required to protect anonymous or pseudonymous works in respect of which it is reasonable to presume that their author has been dead for fifty years.

(4)It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the term of protection of photographic works and that of works of applied art in so far as they are protected as artistic works; however, this term shall last at least until the end of a period of twenty-five years from the making of such a work.

(5)The term of protection subsequent to the death of the author and the terms provided by paragraphs (2),

(3)and (4) shall run from the date of death or of the event referred to in those paragraphs, but such terms shall always be deemed to begin on the first of January of the year following the death or such event.





page 7 / 29

(6)The countries of the Union may grant a term of protection in excess of those provided by the preceding paragraphs.

(7)Those countries of the Union bound by the Rome Act of this Convention which grant, in their national legislation in force at the time of signature of the present Act, shorter terms of protection than those provided for in the preceding paragraphs shall have the right to maintain such terms when ratifying or acceding to the present Act.

(8)In any case, the term shall be governed by the legislation of the country where protection is claimed; however, unless the legislation of that country otherwise provides, the term shall not exceed the term fixed in the country of origin of the work.

Article 7bis

[Term of Protection for Works of Joint Authorship]

The provisions of the preceding Article shall also apply in the case of a work of joint authorship, provided that the terms measured from the death of the author shall be calculated from the death of the last surviving author.

Article 8

[Right of Translation]

Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention shall enjoy the exclusive right of making and of authorizing the translation of their works throughout the term of protection of their rights in the original works.

Article 9

[Right of Reproduction: 1. Generally; 2. Possible exceptions; 3. Sound and visual recordings]

(1)Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorizing the reproduction of these works, in any manner or form.

(2)It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the reproduction of such works in certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.

(3)Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction for the purposes of this Convention.

Article 10

[Certain Free Uses of Works: 1. Quotations; 2. Illustrations for teaching; 3. Indication of source and author]

(1)It shall be permissible to make quotations from a work which has already been lawfully made available to the public, provided that their making is compatible with fair practice, and their extent does not exceed that justified by the purpose, including quotations from newspaper articles and periodicals in the form of press summaries.

(2)It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union, and for special agreements existing or to be concluded between them, to permit the utilization, to the extent justified by the purpose, of literary or artistic works by way of illustration in publications, broadcasts or sound or visual recordings for teaching, provided such utilization is compatible with fair practice.

(3)Where use is made of works in accordance with the preceding paragraphs of this Article, mention shall be made of the source, and of the name of the author if it appears thereon.









page 8 / 29

Article 10bis

[Further Possible Free Uses of Works: 1. Of certain articles and broadcast works; 2. Of works seen or heard in connection with current events]

(1)It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the reproduction by the press, the broadcasting or the communication to the public by wire of articles published in newspapers or periodicals on current economic, political or religious topics, and of broadcast works of the same character, in cases in which the reproduction, broadcasting or such communication thereof is not expressly reserved. Nevertheless, the source must always be clearly indicated; the legal consequences of a breach of this obligation shall be determined by the legislation of the country where protection is claimed.

(2)It shall also be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the conditions under which, for the purpose of reporting current events by means of photography, cinematography, broadcasting or communication to the public by wire, literary or artistic works seen or heard in the course of the event may, to the extent justified by the informatory purpose, be reproduced and made available to the public.

Article 11

(i)the public performance of their works, including such public performance by any means or process;

(ii)any communication to the public of the performance of their works.

(2)Authors of dramatic or dramatico-musical works shall enjoy, during the full term of their rights in the original works, the same rights with respect to translations thereof.

Article 11bis

[Broadcasting and Related Rights: 1. Broadcasting and other wireless communications, public communication of broadcast by wire or rebroadcast, public communication of broadcast by loudspeaker or analogous instruments; 2. Compulsory licenses; 3. Recording; ephemeral recordings]

(1)Authors of literary and artistic works shall enjoy the exclusive right of authorizing:

(i)the broadcasting of their works or the communication thereof to the public by any other means of wireless diffusion of signs, sounds or images;

(ii)any communication to the public by wire or by rebroadcasting of the broadcast of the work, when this communication is made by an organization other than the original one;

(iii)the public communication by loudspeaker or any other analogous instrument transmitting, by signs, sounds or images, the broadcast of the work.

(2)It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the conditions under which the rights mentioned in the preceding paragraph may be exercised, but these conditions shall apply only in the countries where they have been prescribed. They shall not in any circumstances be prejudicial to the moral rights of the author, nor to his right to obtain equitable remuneration which, in the absence of agreement, shall be fixed by competent authority.

(3)In the absence of any contrary stipulation, permission granted in accordance with paragraph (1) of this Article shall not imply permission to record, by means of instruments recording sounds or images, the work broadcast. It shall, however, be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the regulations for ephemeral recordings made by a broadcasting organization by means of its own facilities and used for its own broadcasts. The preservation of these recordings in official archives may, on the ground of their exceptional documentary character, be authorized by such legislation.







page 9 / 29

Article 11ter

(ii)any communication to the public of the recitation of their works.

(2)Authors of literary works shall enjoy, during the full term of their rights in the original works, the same rights with respect to translations thereof.

Article 12

Article 13

[Possible Limitation of the Right of Recording of Musical Works and Any Words Pertaining Thereto:

(a.) Transhipment from one vessel to another is not excluded by the words "" navigable to and from the sea "" ;

(L.) Any natural waterway or part of a natural waterway is. termed "" naturally navigable "" if now used for ordinary commercial navigation , or capable by reason of its natural conditions of being so used; by "" ordinary commercial navigation "" is to be understood navigation which, in view of the economic condition of the riparian countries, is. commercial and normally practicable;

(c.) Tributaries are to be considered as separate waterways;

(d.) Lateral canals constructed in order to remedy the defects of a waterway included in the above definition are assimilated thereto ;

(e.) The different States separated or traversed by a navigable waterway of international concern , including its tributaries of international concern, are deemed to be

ARTICLE	10.

1. Each riparian State is bound, on the one hand, to refrain from all measures likely to prejudice the navigability of the water-way, or to reduce the facilities for navigation, and on the other hand, to take as rapidly as possible all necessary steps for removing any obstacles and dangers which may occur to navigation.

2. If such navigation necessitates regular upkeep of the water-way, each of the riparian States is bound as towards the others to take such steps and to execute such works on its territory as are necessary for the purpose as quickly as possible, taking account at. all times of the conditions of navigation, as well as of the economic state of the regions served by the navigable waterway.

In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, any riparian State will have the right. on valid reason being shown, to demand from the other riparians a reasonable contribution towards the cost of upkeep.

3. In the absence of legitimate. grounds for opposition by one of the riparian States, including the State territorially interested. based either on the actual conditions of navigability in its territory, or on other interests such as, inter alia. the maintenance of the normal-water conditions, requirements for irrigation, the use of water-power, or the necessity for constructing other and more advantageous ways of communication, a riparian State may not refuse to carry out works necessary for the improvement of the navigability which are asked for by another riparian State, if the latter State offers to pay the cost of the works and a fair share of the additional cost of upkeep. It is understood, however, that such works cannot be undertaken so long as the State on the territory of which they are to be carried out objects on the ground of vital interests.
4. In the absence of any agreement to the contrary, a State
r
which is obliged to carry out works of upkeep is entitled to free itself from the obligation, if, with the consent of all the co-riparian States, one or more of them agree to carry out the works instead of it; as regards works for improvement, a State which is obliged to carry them out shall be freed from the obligation, if it authorises the State which made the request to carry them out instead of it.

5.On the waterways referred to in Article 2, the provisions of the present Article are to be applied subject to the terms of the Treaties, Conventions, or Navigation Acts which determine the powers and responsibilities of the International Commission in respect of works.

Subject to any special provisions in the. said Treaties, Con-ventions, or Navigation Acts, which exist or may be concluded :

(a)Decisions in regard to works will be made by the Commission.

(b)The settlement , under the conditions laid down in Article 22 below , of any dispute which may arise as a result of these decisions , may always be demanded on the grounds that these decisions are ultra wires , or that they infringe international conventions governing navigable waterways. A request for a settlement under the aforesaid conditions based on any other grounds can only be put forward by the State which is territorially interested.

The decisions of this Commission shall be in conformity with the provisions of the present Article.

6.Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph I of this Article. a riparian State may, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, close a waterway wholly or in part to navigation, with the consent of all the riparian States or of all. the States represented on the International Commission in the case of navigable waterways referred to in Article 2.
As an exceptional case one of the riparian States of a navigable waterway of international concern not referred to in Article 2 may close the waterway to navigation , if the navigation on it is of very small importance , and if the State in question can justify its action on the ground of an economic interest clearly greater than that of navigation . In this case the closing to navigation may only take place after a year ' s notice and subject to an appeal on the part of any other riparian State under the conditions laid down in Article 22. If necessary , the judgment shall prescribe the conditions under which the closing to navigation may he carried into effect.

7.Should access to the sea be afforded by a navigable waterway of international interest through several branches , all of which are situated in the territory of one and the same State , the provisions of paragraphs 1. 2 and3 of this Article shall apply only to the principal branches deemed necessary for providing free acces's to the sea.

obligations undertaken by each of the Contracting States in pursuance of Article 10 shall not exceed those to which they would have been subject if all the riparian States had been Parties.

ARTICLE	12.

In the absence of contrary stipulations contained in a special agreement or treaty, for example, existing Conventions concerning customs and police measures and sanitary precautions, the administration of navigable waterways of international concern is exercised by each of the riparian States under whose sovereignty or authority the navigable waterway is situated. Each of such riparian States has, inter alia, the power and duty of publishing regulations for the navigation of such waterway and of seeing to their execution. These regulations must be framed and applied in such a way as to facilitate the free exercise of navigation under the conditions laid down in this Statute.

The rules of procedure dealing with such matters as ascertaining, prosecuting and punishing navigation offences must be such as to promote as speedy a settlement as possible.

Nevertheless the Contracting States recognise that it is highly desirable that the riparian States should come to an understanding with regard to the administration of the navigable waterway and, in particular, with regard to the adoption of navigation regulations of as uniform a character throughout the whole course of such navigable waterway as the. diversity of local circumstances permits.

Public services of towage or other means of haulage may be established in the form of monopolies for the purpose of facilitating the exercise of navigation, subject to the unanimous agreement of the riparian States or the States represented on the International Commission in the case of navigable waterways referred to in Article 2.

ARTICLE 13.

Treaties, conventions or agreements in force relating to navigable waterways, concluded by the Contracting States before the coming into force of this Statute, are not, as a consequence of its conning into force, abrogated so far as concerns the States signatories !o those treaties.

Nevertheless the Contracting States undertake not to apply among themselves any provisions of such treaties, conventions or agreements which may conflict with the rules of the present Statute

ARTICLE I

Purposes

The purposes of the Bank are:

(i)To assist in the reconstruction and development of territories of members by facilitating the investment of capital for productive purposes, including the restoration of economies destroyed or disrupted by war, the reconversion of productive facilities to peacetime needs and the encouragement of the development of productive facilities and resources in less developed countries.

(ii)To promote private foreign investment by means of guarantees or participations in loans and other investments made by private investors; and when private capital is not available on reasonable terms, to supplement private investment by providing, on suitable conditions, finance for productive purposes out of its own capital, funds raised by it and its other resources.

(iii)To promote the long-range balanced growth of international trade and the maintenance of equilibrium in balances of payments by encouraging international investment for the development of the productive resources of members, thereby assisting in raising productivity, the standard of living and conditions of labor in their territories.

(iv)To arrange the loans made or guaranteed by it in relation to international loans through other channels so that the more useful and urgent projects, large and small alike, will be dealt with first.

(v)To conduct its operations with due regard to the effect of international investment on business conditions in the territories of members and, in the immediate postwar years, to assist in bringing about a smooth transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy.

The Bank shall be guided in all its decisions by the purposes set forth above

ARTICLE II

(b)Membership shall be open to other members of the Fund, at such times and in accordance with such terms as may be prescribed by the Bank.

SECTION 2. Authorized Capital

(a)The authorized capital stock of the Bank shall be $10,000,000,000, in terms of United States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on July 1, 1944. The capital stock shall be divided into 100,000 shares (1) having

a par value of $100,000 each, which shall be available for subscription only by members.

(b)The capital stock may be increased when the Bank deems it advisable by a three-fourths majority of the total voting power.

SECTION 3. Subscription of Shares

(a)Each member shall subscribe shares of the capital stock of the Bank. The minimum number of shares to be subscribed by the original members shall be those set forth in Schedule A. The minimum number of shares to be subscribed by other members shall be determined by the Bank, which shall reserve a sufficient portion of its capital stock for subscription by such members.

(b)The Bank shall prescribe rules laying down the conditions under which members may subscribe shares of the authorized capital stock of the Bank in addition to their minimum subscriptions.

1.As of April 27, 1988, the authorized capital stock of the Bank had been increased to 1,420,500 shares.

(c)If the authorized capital stock of the Bank is increased, each member shall have a reasonable opportunity to subscribe, under such conditions as the Bank shall decide, a proportion of the increase of stock equivalent to the proportion which its stock theretofore subscribed bears to the total capital stock of the Bank, but no member shall be obligated to subscribe any part of the increased capital.

SECTION 4. Issue Price of Shares

Shares included in the minimum subscriptions of original members shall be issued at par. Other shares shall be issued at par unless the Bank by a majority of the total voting power decides in special circumstances to issue them on other terms.

SECTION 5. Division and Calls of Subscribed Capital

The subscription of each member shall be divided into two parts as follows:

(i)twenty percent shall be paid or subject to call under Section 7 (i) of this Article as needed by the Bank for its operations;

(ii)the remaining eighty percent shall be subject to call by the Bank only when required to meet obligations of the Bank created under Article IV, Sections 1 (a) (ii) and (iii).

Calls on unpaid subscriptions shall be uniform on all shares.

SECTION 6. Limitation on Liability

Liability on shares shall be limited to the unpaid portion of the issue price of the shares.

SECTION 7. Method of Payment of Subscriptions for Shares

Payment of subscriptions for shares shall be made in gold or United States dollars and in the currencies of the members as follows:

(i)under Section 5 (i) of this Article, two percent of the price of each share shall be payable in gold or United States dollars, and, when calls are made, the remaining eighteen percent shall be paid in the currency of the member;

(ii)when a call is made under Section 5 (ii) of this Article, payment may be made at the option of the member either in gold, in United States dollars or in the currency required to discharge the obligations of the Bank for the purpose for which the call is made;

(iii)when a member makes payments in any currency under (i) and (ii) above, such payments

shall be made in amounts equal in value to the member's liability under the call. This liability shall be a proportionate part of the subscribed capital stock of the Bank as authorized and defined in Section 2 of this Article.

SECTION 8. Time of Payment of Subscriptions

(a)The two percent payable on each share in gold or United States dollars under Section 7 (i) of this Article, shall be paid within sixty days of the date on which the Bank begins operations, provided that

(i)any original member of the Bank whose metropolitan territory has suffered from enemy occupation or hostilities during the present war shall be granted the right to postpone payment of one-half percent until five years after that date;

(ii)an original member who cannot make such a payment because it has not recovered possession of its gold reserves which are still seized or immobilized as a result of the war may postpone an payment until such date as the Bank shall decide.

(b)The remainder of the price of each share payable under Section 7 (i) of this Article shall be paid as and when called by the Bank, provided that

(i)the Bank shall, within one year of its beginning operations, call not less than eight percent of the price of the share in addition to the payment of two percent referred to in (a) above;

(ii)not more than five percent of the price of the share shall be called in any period of three months.

SECTION 9. Maintenance of Value of Certain Currency Holdings of the Bank

(a)Whenever (i) the par value of a member's currency is reduced, or (ii) the foreign exchange value of a member's currency has, in the opinion of the Bank, depreciated to a significant extent within that member's territories, the member shall pay to the Bank within a reasonable time an additional amount of its own currency sufficient to maintain the value, as of the time of initial subscription, of the amount of the currency of such member which is held by the Bank and derived from currency originally paid in to the Bank by the member under Article II, Section 7 (i), from currency referred to in Article IV, Section 2 (b), or from any additional currency furnished under the provisions of the present paragraph, and which has not been repurchased by the member for gold or for the currency of any member which is acceptable to the Bank.

(b)Whenever the par value of a member's currency is increased, the Bank shall return to such member within a reasonable time an amount of that member's currency equal to the increase in the value of the amount of such currency described in (a) above.

(c)The provisions of the preceding paragraphs may be waived by the Bank when a uniform proportionate change in the par values of the currencies of all its members is made by the International Monetary Fund.

(iii)A competent committee, as provided for in Article V, Section 7, has submitted a written report recommending the project after a careful study of the merits of the proposal.

(iv)In the opinion of the Bank the rate of interest and other charges are reasonable and such rate, charges and the schedule for repayment of principal are appropriate to the project.

(v)In making or guaranteeing a loan, the Bank shall pay due regard to the prospects that the borrower, and, if the borrower is not a member, that the guarantor, will be in position to meet its obligations under the loan;

and the Bank shall act prudently in the interests both of the particular member in whose territories the project is located and of the members as a whole.

is denominated, and only if those members agree that the proceeds may be exchanged for the currency of any other member without restriction.

SECTION 2. Availability and Transferability of Currencies

(a)Currencies paid into the Bank under Article II, Section 7 (i), shall be loaned only with the approval in each case of the member whose currency is involved; provided, however, that if necessary, after the Bank’s subscribed capital has been entirely called, such currencies shall, without restriction by the members whose currencies are offered, be used or exchanged for the currencies required to meet contractual payments of interest, other charges or amortization on the Bank's own borrowings, or to meet the Bank's liabilities with respect to such contractual payments on loans guaranteed by the Bank.

(b)Currencies received by the Bank from borrowers or guarantors in payment on account of principal of direct loans made with currencies referred to in (a) above shall be exchanged for the currencies of other members or reloaned only with the approval in each case of the members whose currencies are involved; provided, however, that if necessary, after the Bank's subscribed capital has been entirely called, such currencies shall, without restriction by the members whose currencies are offered, be used or exchanged for the currencies required to meet contractual payments of interest, other charges or amortization on the Bank's own borrowings, or to meet the Bank’s liabilities with respect to such contractual payments on loans guaranteed by the Bank.

(c)Currencies received by the Bank from borrowers or guarantors in payment on account of principal of direct loans made by the Bank under Section 1 (a) (ii) of this Article, shall be held and used, without restriction by the members, to make amortization payments, or to anticipate payment of or repurchase part or all of the Bank's own obligations.

(d)All other currencies available to the Bank, including those raised in the market or otherwise borrowed under Section 1 (a) (ii) of this Article, those obtained by the sale of gold, those received as payments of interest and other charges for direct loans made under Sections 1 (a) (i) and (ii), and those received as payments of commissions and other charges under Section 1 (a) (iii), shall be used or exchanged for other currencies or gold required in the operations of the Bank without restriction by the members whose currencies are offered.

(e)Currencies raised in the markets of members by borrowers on loans guaranteed by the Bank under Section1 (a) (iii) of this Article, shall also be used or exchanged for other currencies without restriction by such members.

SECTION 3. Provision of Currencies for Direct Loans

The following provisions shall apply to direct loans under Sections I (a) (i) and (ii) of this Article:

(a)The Bank shall furnish the borrower with such currencies of members, other than the member in whose territories the project is located, as are needed by the borrower for expenditures to be made in the territories of such other members to carry out the purposes of the loan.

(b)The Bank may, in exceptional circumstances when local currency required for the purposes of the loan cannot be raised by the borrower on reasonable terms, provide the borrower as part of the loan with an appropriate amount of that currency.

(c)The Bank, if the project gives rise indirectly to an increased need for foreign exchange by the member in whose territories the project is located, may in exceptional circumstances provide the borrower as part of the loan with an appropriate amount of gold or foreign exchange not in excess of the borrower's local expenditure in connection with the purposes of the loan.

(d)The Bank may, in exceptional circumstances, at the request of a member in whose territories a portion of the loan is spent, repurchase with gold or foreign exchange a part of that member's currency thus spent but in no case shall the part so repurchased exceed the amount by which the expenditure of the loan in those territories gives rise to an increased need for foreign exchange.

SECTION 4. Payment Provisions for Direct Loans

Loan contracts under Section 1 (a) (i) or (ii) of this Article shall be made in accordance with the following payment provisions:

(a)The terms and conditions of interest and amortization payments, maturity and dates of payment of each loan shall be determined by the Bank. The Bank shall also determine the rate and any other terms and conditions of commission to be charged in connection with such loan.

In the case of loans made under Section 1 (a) (ii) of this Article during the first ten years of the Bank's operations, this rate of commission shall be not less than one percent per annum and not greater than one and one-half percent per annum, and shall be charged on the outstanding portion of any such loan. At the end of this period of ten years, the rate of commission may be reduced by the Bank with respect both to the outstanding portions of loans already made and to future loans, if the reserves accumulated by the Bank under Section 6 of this Article and out of other earnings are considered by it sufficient to justify a reduction. In the case of future loans the Bank shall also have discretion to increase the rate of commission beyond the above limit, if experience indicates that an increase is advisable.

(b)All loan contracts shall stipulate the currency or currencies in which payments under the contract shall be made to the Bank. At the option of the borrowers however, such payments may be made in gold, or subject to the agreement of the Bank, in the currency of a member other than that prescribed in the contract.

(i)In the case of loans made under Section 1 (a) (i) of this Article, the loan contracts shall provide that payments to the Bank of interest, other charges and amortization shall be made in the currency loaned, unless the member whose currency is loaned agrees that such payments shall be made in some other specified currency or currencies. These payments, subject to the provisions of Article II, Section 9 (c), shall be equivalent to the value of such contractual payments at the time the loans were made, in terms of a currency specified for the purpose by the Bank by a three-fourths majority of the total voting power.

(ii)In the case of loans made under Section 1 (a) (ii) of this Article, the total amount outstanding and payable to the Bank in any one currency shall at no time exceed the total amount of the outstanding borrowings made by the Bank under Section 1 (a) (ii) and payable in the same currency.

(c)If a member suffers from an acute exchange stringency, so that the service of any loan contracted by that member or guaranteed by it or by one of its agencies cannot be provided in the stipulated manner, the member concerned may apply to the Bank for a relaxation of the conditions of payment. if the Bank is satisfied that some relaxation is in the interests of the particular member and of the operations of the Bank and

of its members as a whole, it may take action under either, or both, of the following paragraphs with respect to the whole, or part, of the annual service:

(i)The Bank may, in its discretion, make arrangements with the member concerned to accept service payments on the loan in the member's currency for periods not to exceed three years upon appropriate terms regarding the use of such currency and the maintenance of its foreign exchange value; and for the repurchase of such currency on appropriate terms.

(ii)The Bank may modify the terms of amortization or extend the life of the loan, or both.

SECTION 5. Guarantees

(a)In guaranteeing a loan placed through the usual investment channels, the Bank shall charge a guarantee commission payable periodically on the amount of the loan outstanding at a rate determined by the Bank. During the first ten years of the Bank's operations, this rate shall be not less than one percent per annum and not greater than one and one-half percent per annum. At the end of this period of ten years, the rate of commission may be reduced by the Bank with respect both to the outstanding portions of loans already guaranteed and to future loans if the reserves accumulated by the Bank under Section 6 of this Article and out of other earnings are considered by it sufficient to justify a reduction. In the case of future loans the Bank

shall also have discretion to increase the rate of commission beyond the above limit, if experience indicates that an increase is advisable.

(b)Guarantee commissions shall be paid directly to the Bank by the borrower.

(c)Guarantees by the Bank shall provide that the Bank may terminate its liability with respect to interest if, upon default by the borrower and by the guarantor, if any, the Bank offers to purchase, at par and interest accrued to a date designated in the offer, the bonds or other obligations guaranteed-

(d)The Bank shall have power to determine any other terms and conditions of the guarantee.

SECTION 6. Special Reserve

The amount of commissions received by the Bank under Sections 4 and 5 of this Article shall be set aside as a special reserve, which shall be kept available for meeting liabilities of the Bank in accordance with Section 7 of this Article. The special reserve shall be held in such liquid form, permitted under this Agreement, as the Executive Directors may decide.

SECTION 7. Methods of Meeting Liabilities of the Bank in Case of Defaults

In cases of default on loans made, participated in, or guaranteed by the Bank:

(a)The Bank shall make such arrangements as may be feasible to adjust the obligations under the loans, including arrangements under or analogous to those provided in Section 4 (c) of this Article.

(b)The payments in discharge of the Bank’s liabilities on borrowings or guarantees under Section 1 (a) (ii) and (iii) of this Article shall be charged:

(i)first, against the special reserve provided in Section 6 of this Article;

(ii)then, to the extent necessary and at the discretion of the Bank, against the other reserves, surplus and capital available to the Bank.

(c)Whenever necessary to meet contractual payments of interest, other charges or amortization on the Bank's own borrowings, or to meet the Bank’s liabilities with respect to similar payments on loans guaranteed by it, the Bank may call an appropriate amount of the unpaid subscriptions of members in accordance with Article II, Sections 5 and 7. Moreover, if it believes that a default may be of long duration, the Bank may call an additional amount of such unpaid subscriptions not to exceed in any one year one percent of the total subscriptions of the

members for the following purposes:

(i)To redeem prior to maturity, or otherwise discharge its liability on, all or part of the outstanding principal of any loan guaranteed by it in respect of which the debtor is in default.

(ii)To repurchase, or otherwise discharge its liability on, all or part of its own outstanding borrowings.

SECTION 8. Miscellaneous Operations

In addition to the operations specified elsewhere in this Agreement, the Bank shall have the power:

(i)To buy and sell securities it has issued and to buy and sell securities which it has guaranteed or in which it has invested, provided that the Bank shall obtain the approval of the member in whose territories the securities are to be bought or sold.

(ii)To guarantee securities in which it has invested for the purpose of facilitating their sale.

(iii)To borrow the currency of any member with the approval of that member.

(iv)To buy and sell such other securities as the Directors by a three-fourths majority of the total voting power may deem proper for the investment-of all or part of the special reserve under Section 6 of this Article.

In exercising the powers conferred by this Section, the Bank may deal with any person, partnership, association, corporation or other legal entity in the territories of any member.

SECTION 9. Warning to be Placed on Securities

Every security guaranteed or issued by the Bank shall bear on its face a conspicuous statement to the effect that it is not an obligation of any government unless expressly stated on the security.

SECTION 10. Political Activity Prohibited

The Bank and its officers shall not interfere in the political affairs of any member; nor shall they be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or members concerned. Only economic considerations shall be relevant to their decisions, and these considerations shall be weighed impartially in order to achieve the purposes stated in Article I.

ARTICLE  II

The undertaking by a signatory provided for in Article I shall apply to the merchandise trade of any area referred to therein only for such time and to such extent as such area accords reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment to the merchandise trade of the territory of such signatory.

ARTICLE  III

ANNEX

INTERPRETATIVE  NOTES

1.It is recognized that the absence of a uniform rate of exchange for the currency of the areas in Western Germany, referred to in Article I may have the effect of indirectly subsidizing the exports of such areas to an extent which it would be difficult to calculate exactly. So long as such a condition exists,

and if consultation with the appropriate authorities fails to result within a rea-sonable time in an agreed solution to the problem, it is understood that it would not be inconsistent with the undertaking in Article I for any signatory to levy a countervailing duty on imports of such goods, equivalent to the estimated amount of such subsidization, where such signatory determines that the subsidization is such as to cause or threaten material injury to an established domestic industry or is such as to prevent or materially retard the establishment of, a domestic industry. In circumstances of special urgency, where delay would cause damage which it would be difficult to repair, action may be taken provisionally without prior consultation, on the condition that consultation shall be effected immediately after taking such action.

2.The reference to the most-favoured-nation provisions of the General Agreement is understood to cover all the provisions of the General Agreement relevant to most-favoured-nation treatment as well as Article I.

3.The standard of the treatment to be accorded is set by all the most-favoured-nation provisions of the General Agreement (including the ex-ceptions) and accordingly, under the reciprocity clause of Article II of this

Agreement, the same standard would be used to measure the treatment re-ceived. If in the judgment of a signatory, that signatory was not actually

receiving the most-favoured-nation treatment conforming to the standard, it would not consider itself obligated to grant treatment in accordance with

•TS 993, ante, yol. 3, p. 1176.




219-918--70----50

768	MULTILATERAL  AGREEMENTS	1946-1949

the standard. Differences of view between signatories would naturally, how-ever, be the subject of consultation.

4.The reference in Article III to ""the principles relating to the reduction of tariffs on a mutually advantageous basis which are set forth in the Havana Charter"", is designed to permit a signatory to withhold most-favoured-nation treatment in the event of the failure of an area under occupation-assuming that significant or effective tariffs were to be imposed by such area-to nego-tiate in accordance with the principles of Article 17 of the Havana Charter and in conformity with the established procedure for tariff negotiations.

No. 449. AMERICAN TREATY1 ON PACIFIC SETTLEMENT (""PACT OF BOGOTA""). SIGNED AT BOGOTA, ON 30 APRIL 1948

In the name of their peoples, the Governments represented at the Ninth International Conference of American States have resolved, in fulfillment of Article XXIII of the Charter of the Organization of American States, to conclude the following Treaty:

Chapter one

GENERAL OBLIGATION TO SETTLE DISPUTES BY PACIFIC MEANS

Article I. The High Contracting Parties, solemnly reaffirming their commit ments made in earlier international conventions and declarations, as well as in the Charter of the United Nations, agree to refrain from the threat or the use of force, or from any other means of coercion for the settlement of their contro versies, and to have recourse at all times to pacific procedures.

Article II. The High Contracting Parties recognize the obligation to settle international controversies by regional pacific procedures before referring them to the Security Council of the United Nations.
Consequently, in the event that a controversy arises between two or more signatory States which, in the opinion of the parties, cannot be settled by direct negotiations through the usual diplomatic channels, the parties bind themselves to use the procedures established in the present Treaty, in the manner and under the conditions provided for in the following articles, or, alternatively, such special procedures as, in their opinion, will permit them to arrive at a solution.

Article III. The order of the pacific procedures established in the present Treaty does not signify that the parties may not have recourse to the procedure which they consider most appropriate in each case, or that they should use all these procedures, or that any of them have preference over others except as expressly provided.

Article IV. Once any pacific procedure has been initiated, whether by agreement between the parties or in fulfillment of the present Treaty or a previous pact, no other procedure may be commenced until that procedure is concluded.

*In accordance with article LUI, the treaty came into force on 6 May 1949 in respect of Mexico and Costa Rica, which deposited their instruments of ratification with the Pan Ameri

can Union on 23 November 1948 and 6 May 1949, respectively.

86	United Nations — Treaty Series	1949

Article V. The aforesaid procedures may not be applied to matters which, by their nature, are within the domestic jurisdiction of the State. If the parties are not in agreement as to whether the controversy concerns a matter of domestic jurisdiction, this preliminary question shall be submitted to decision by the International Court of Justice, at the request of any of the parties.

Article VI. The aforesaid procedures, furthermore, may not be applied to matters already settled by arrangement between the parties, or by arbitral award or by decision of an international court, or which are governed by agreements or treaties in force on the date of the conclusion of the present Treaty.

Article VII. The High Contracting Parties bind themselves not to make diplomatic representations in order to protect their nationals, or to refer a controversy to a court of international jurisdiction for that purpose, when the said nationals have had available the means to place their case before competent domestic courts of the respective State.

Article VIII. Neither recourse to pacific means for the solution of controversies, nor the recommendation of their use, shall, in the case of an armed attack, be ground for delaying the exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense, as provided for in the Charter of the United Nations.

Chapter two

PROCEDURES OF GOOD OFFICES AND MEDIATION

Article IX. The procedure of good offices consists in the attempt by one or more American Governments not parties to the controversy, or by one or more eminent citizens of any American State which is not a party to the contro versy, to bring the parties together, so as to make it possible for them to reach an adequate solution between themselves.

Article X. Once the parties have been brought together and have resumed direct negotiations, no further action is to be taken by the States or citizens that have offered their good offices or have accepted an invitation to offer them; they may, however, by agreement between the parties, be present at the negotiations.

Article XI. The procedure of mediation consists in the submission of the controversy to one or more American Governments not parties to the contro versy, or to one or more eminent citizens of any American State not a party to the controversy. In either case the mediator or mediators shall be chosen by mutual agreement between the parties.


No.  449

88	United Nations — Treaty Series	1949

Article XII. The functions of the mediator or mediators shall be to assist the parties in the settlement of controversies in the simplest and most direct manner, avoiding formalities and seeking an acceptable solution. No report shall be made by the mediator and, so far as he is concerned, the proceedings shall be wholly confidential.

Article XIII. In the event that the High Contracting Parties have agreed to the procedure of mediation but are unable to reach an agreement within two months on the selection of the mediator or mediators, or no solution to the controversy has been reached within five months after mediation has begun, the parties shall have recourse without delay to any one of the other procedures of peaceful settlement established in the present Treaty.

Article XIV. The High Contracting Parties may offer their mediation, either individually or jointly, but they agree not to do so while the controversy is in process of settlement by any of the other procedures established in the present Treaty.

Chapter three

PROCEDURE OF INVESTIGATION AND CONCILIATION

Article XV. The procedure of investigation and conciliation consists in the submission of the controversy to a Commission of Investigation and Concilia tion, which shall be established in accordance with the provisions established in subsequent articles of the present Treaty, and which shall function within the limitations prescribed therein.

Article XVI. The party initiating the procedure of investigation and conciliation shall request the Council of the Organization of American States to convoke the Commission of Investigation and Conciliation. The Council for its part shall take immediate steps to convoke it.

Once the request to convoke the Commission has been received, the contro versy between the parties shall immediately be suspended, and the parties shall refrain from any act that might make conciliation more difficult. To that end, at the request of one of the parties, the Council of the Organization of American States may, pending the convocation of the Commission, make appropriate recommendations to the parties.

Article XVII. Each of the High Contracting Parties may appoint, by means of a bilateral agreement consisting of a simple exchange of notes with each of the other signatories, two members of the Commission of Investigation and Conciliation, only one of whom may be of its own nationality. The fifth member, who shall perform the functions of chairman, shall be selected immediately by common agreement of the members thus appointed.


No. 449

90	United Nations — Treaty Series	1949

Any one of the contracting parties may remove members whom it has appointed, whether nationals or aliens; at the same time it shall appoint the suc cessor.

The appointments and substitutions shall be registered with the Pan American Union, which shall endeavor to ensure that the commisisons maintain their full complement of five members.

Article XVIII. Without prejudice to the provisions of the foregoing article, the Pan American Union shall draw up a permanent panel of American conciliators, to be made up as follows:

a)Each of the High Contracting Parties shall appoint, for three-year periods, two of their nationals who enjoy the highest reputation for fairness, competence and integrity;

b)The Pan American Union shall request of the candidates notice of their formal acceptance, and it shall place on the panel of conciliators the names of the persons who so notify it;

c)The Governments may, at any time, fill vacancies occurring among their appointees; and they may reappoint their members.

Article XIX. In the event that a controversy should arise between two or more American States that have not appointed the Commission referred to in Article XVII, the following procedure shall be observed:

a)Each party shall designate two members from the permanent panel of American conciliators, who are not of the same nationality as the appoint ing party;

b)These four members shall in turn choose a fifth member, from the permanent panel, not of the nationality of either party;

c)If, within a period of thirty days following the notification of their selection, the four members are unable to agree upon a fifth member, they shall each separately list the conciliators composing the permanent panel, in order of their preference, and upon comparison of the lists so prepared, the one who first receives a majority of votes shall be declared elected. The person so elected shall perform the duties of chairman of the Commission.

Article XX. In convening the Commission of Investigation and Concilia tion, the Council of the Organization of American States shall determine the place where the Commission shall meet. Thereafter the Commission may

92	United Nations — Treaty Series	1949


determine the place or places in which it is to function, taking into account the best facilities for the performance of its work.

Article XXI. When more than two States are involved in the same contro versy, the States that hold similar points of view shall be considered as a single party. If they have different interests they shall be entitled to increase the number of conciliators in order that all parties may have equal representation. The chairman shall be elected in the manner set forth in Article XIX.

Article XXII. It shall be the duty of the Commission of Investigation and Conciliation to clarify the points in dispute between the parties and to endeavor to bring about an agreement between them upon mutually acceptable terms. The Commission shall institute such investigations of the facts involved in the controversy as it may deem necessary for the purpose of proposing acceptable bases of settlement.

Article XXIII. It shall be the duty of the parties to facilitate the work of the Commission and to supply it, to the fullest extent possible, with all useful documents and information, and also to use the means at their disposal to enable the Commission to summon and hear witnesses or experts and perform other tasks in the territories of the parties, in conformity with their laws.

Article XXIV. During the proceedings before the Commission, the parties shall be represented by plenipotentiary delegates or by agents, who shall serve as intermediaries between them and the Commission. The parties and the Commission may use the services of technical advisers and experts.

%
Article XXV. The Commission shall conclude its work within a period of six months from the date of its installation; but the parties may, by mutual agreement, extend the period.

Article XXVI. If, in the opinion of the parties, the controversy relates exclusively to questions of fact, the Commission shall limit itself to investigating such questions, and shall conclude its activities with an appropriate report.

Article XXVII. If an agreement is reached by conciliation, the final report of the Commission shall be limited to the text of the agreement and shall be published after its transmittal to the parties, unless the parties decide other wise. If no agreement is reached, the final report shall contain a summary of the work of the Commission; it shall be delivered to the parties, and shall be published after the expiration of six months unless the parties decide otherwise. In both cases, the final report shall be adopted by a majority vote.


No. 449

94	United Nations — Treaty Series	1949

Article XXVIII. The reports and conclusions of the Commission of Investi gation and Conciliation shall not be binding upon the parties, either with respect to the statement of facts or in regard to questions of law, and they shall have no other character than that of recommendations submitted for the con sideration of the parties in order to facilitate a friendly settlement of the contro versy.

Article XXIX. The Commission of Investigation and Conciliation shall transmit to each of the parties, as well as to the Pan American Union, certified copies of the minutes of its proceedings. These minutes shall not be published unless the parties so decide.

RESERVATIONS

Argentina

""The Delegation of the Argentine Republic, on signing the American Treaty on Pacific Settlement (Pact of Bogota), makes reservations in regard to the following articles, to which it does not adhere:

""1) VII,  concerning the protection of aliens;

""2)  Chapter Four (Articles XXXI to XXXVII), Judicial Procedure;

""3) Chapter Five (Articles XXXVIII to XLIX), Procedure of Arbitration;

""4)  Chapter Six (Article L), Fulfillment of Decisions.

""Arbitration and judicial procedure have, as institutions, the firm adherence of the Argentine Republic, but the Delegation cannot accept the form in which the procedures for their application have been regulated, since, in its opinion, they should have been established only for controversies arising in the future and not originating in or having any relation to causes, situations or facts existing before the signing of this instrument. The compulsory execution of arbitral or judicial decisions and the limitation which prevents the States from judging for themselves in regard to matters that pertain to their domestic jurisdiction in accordance with Article V are contrary to Argentine tradition. The protection of aliens, who in the Argentine Republic are protected by its Supreme Law to the same extent as the nationals, is also contrary to that tradition.""

Bolivia

""The Delegation of Bolivia makes a reservation with regard to Article VI, inasmuch as it considers that pacific procedures may also be applied to controversies arising from matters settled by arrangement between the Parties, when the said arrangement affects the vital interests of a State.""

Ecuador

""The Delegation of Ecuador, upon signing this Pact, makes an express reservation with regard to Article VI and also every provision that contradicts or is not in harmony with the principles proclaimed by or the stipulations contained in the Charter of the United Nations, the Charter of the Organization of American States, or the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador.""


No.  449

110	United Nations — Treaty Series	1949

United States of America

""1. The United States does not undertake as the complainant State to submit to the International Court of Justice any controversy which is not considered to be properly within the jurisdiction of the Court.

""2. The submission on the part of the United States of any controversy to arbitration, as distinguished from judicial settlement, shall be dependent upon the conclusion of a special agreement between the parties to the case.

""3. The acceptance by the United States of the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice as compulsory ipso facto and without special agreement, as provided in this Treaty, is limited by any jurisdictional or other limitations contained in any Declaration deposited by the United States under Article 36, paragraph 4, of the Statute of the Court, and in force at the time of the submission of any case.

""4. The Government of the United States cannot accept Article VII relating to diplomatic protection and the exhaustion of remedies. For its part, the Government of the United States maintains the rules of diplomatic protection, including the rule of exhaustion of local remedies by aliens, as provided by international law.""

Paraguay

""The Delegation of Paraguay makes the following reservation:

""Paraguay stipulates the prior agreement of the parties as a prerequisite to the arbitration procedure established in this Treaty for every question of a non-juridical nature affecting national sovereignty and not specifically agreed upon in treaties now in force.""

Peru

""The Delegation of Peru makes the following reservations:

""1. Reservation with regard to the second part of Article V, because it considers that domestic jurisdiction should be defined by the State itself.

""2. Reservation with regard to Article XXXIII and the pertinent part of Article XXXIV, inasmuch as it considers that the exceptions of res judicata, resolved by settlement between the parties or governed by agreements and treaties in force, determine, in virtue of their objective and peremptory nature, the exclusion of these cases from the application of every procedure.


No. 449

112	United Nations — Treaty Series	1949

""3. Reservation with regard to Article XXXV, in the sense that, before arbitration is resorted to, there may be, at the request of one of the parties, a meeting of the Organ of Consultation, as established in the Charter of the Organization of American States.

""4. Reservation with regard to Article XLV, because it believes that arbitration set up without the participation of one of the parties is in contradiction with its constitutional provisions.""

Nicaragua

""The Nicaraguan Delegation, on giving its approval to the American Treaty on Pacific Settlement (Pact of Bogota) wishes to record expressly that no provisions contained in the said Treaty may prejudice any position assumed by the Government of Nicaragua with respect to arbitral decisions the validity of which it has contested on the basis of the principles of international law, which clearly permit arbitral decisions to be attacked when they are adjudged to be null or invalidated. Consequently, the signature of the Nicaraguan Delegation to the Treaty in question cannot be alleged as an acceptance of any arbitral decisions that Nicaragua has contested and the validity of which is not certain.

""Hence the Nicaraguan Delegation reiterates the statement made on the 28th of the current month on approving the text of the above-mentioned Treaty in Committee III.""

11.CONVENTION ON THE CONFLICTS OF LAWS RELATING TO THE FORM OF TESTAMENTARY DISPOSITIONS1

(Concluded 5 October 1961)


The States signatory to the present Convention,

Desiring to establish common provisions on the conflicts of laws relating to the form of testamentary dispositions,

Have resolved to conclude a Convention to this effect and have agreed upon the following provisions:


Article 1

A testamentary disposition shall be valid as regards form if its form complies with the internal law:
a)of the place where the testator made it, or

b)of a nationality possessed by the testator, either at the time when he made the disposition, or at the time of his death, or

c)of a place in which the testator had his domicile either at the time when he made the disposition, or at the time of his death, or

d)of the place in which the testator had his habitual residence either at the time when he made the disposition, or at the time of his death, or
e)so far as immovables are concerned, of the place where they are situated.

For the purposes of the present Convention, if a national law consists of a non-unified system, the law to be applied shall be determined by the rules in force in that system and, failing any such rules, by the most real connexion which the testator had with any one of the various laws within that system.

The determination of whether or not the testator had his domicile in a particular place shall be governed by the law of that place.


Article 2

Article 1 shall apply to testamentary dispositions revoking an earlier testamentary disposition.

The revocation shall also be valid as regards form if it complies with any one of the laws according to the terms of which, under Article 1, the testamentary disposition that has been revoked was valid.


Article 3

The present Convention shall not affect any existing or future rules of law in Contracting States which recognise testamentary dispositions made in compliance with the formal requirements of a law other than a law referred to in the preceding Articles.


Article 4

The present Convention shall also apply to the form of testamentary dispositions made by two or more persons in one document.


1This Convention, including related materials, is accessible on the website of the Hague Conference on Private

International Law (www.hcch.net), under “Conventions”. For the full history of the Convention, see Hague Conference on Private International Law, Actes et documents de la Neuvième session (1960), Tome III, Forme des testaments (180 pp.).


Article 5

For the purposes of the present Convention, any provision of law which limits the permitted forms of testamentary dispositions by reference to the age, nationality or other personal conditions of the testator, shall be deemed to pertain to matters of form. The same rule shall apply to the qualifications that must be possessed by witnesses required for the validity of a testamentary disposition.


Article 6

The application of the rules of conflicts laid down in the present Convention shall be independent of any requirement of reciprocity.

The Convention shall be applied even if the nationality of the persons involved or the law to be applied by virtue of the foregoing Articles is not that of a Contracting State.


Article 7

The application of any of the laws declared applicable by the present Convention may be refused only when it is manifestly contrary to ""ordre public"".


Article 8

The present Convention shall be applied in all cases where the testator dies after its entry into force.


Article 9

Each Contracting State may reserve the right, in derogation of the third paragraph of Article 1, to determine in accordance with the lex fori the place where the testator had his domicile.


Article 10

Each Contracting State may reserve the right not to recognise testamentary dispositions made orally, save in exceptional circumstances, by one of its nationals possessing no other nationality.


Article 11

Each Contracting State may reserve the right not to recognise, by virtue of provisions of its own law relating thereto, forms of testamentary dispositions made abroad when the following conditions are fulfilled:

a)the testamentary disposition is valid as to form by reason only of a law solely applicable because of the place where the testator made his disposition,

b)the testator possessed the nationality of the State making the reservation,

c)the testator was domiciled in the said State or had his habitual residence there, and

d)the testator died in a State other than that in which he had made his disposition.

This reservation shall be effective only as to the property situated in the State making the reservation.


Article 12

Each Contracting State may reserve the right to exclude from the application of the present Convention any testamentary clauses which, under its law, do not relate to matters of succession.

Article 13

Each Contracting State may reserve the right, in derogation of Article 8, to apply the present Convention only to testamentary dispositions made after its entry into force.


Article 14

The present Convention shall be open for signature by the States represented at the Ninth Session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law.

It shall be ratified, and the instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.


Article 15

The present Convention shall enter into force on the sixtieth day after the deposit of the third instrument of ratification referred to in the second paragraph of Article 14.

The Convention shall enter into force for each signatory State which ratifies subsequently on the sixtieth day after the deposit of its instrument of ratification.


Article 16

Any State not represented at the Ninth Session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law may accede to the present Convention after it has entered into force in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 15. The instrument of accession shall be deposited with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.

The Convention shall enter into force for a State acceding to it on the sixtieth day after the deposit of its instrument of accession.


Article 17

Any State may, at the time of signature, ratification or accession, declare that the present Convention shall extend to all the territories for the international relations of which it is responsible, or to one or more of them. Such a declaration shall take effect on the date of entry into force of the Convention for the State concerned.

At any time thereafter, such extensions shall be notified to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.

The Convention shall enter into force for the territories mentioned in such an extension on the sixtieth day after the notification referred to in the preceding paragraph.


Article 18

Any State may, not later than the moment of its ratification or accession, make one or more of the reservations mentioned in Articles 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the present Convention. No other reservation shall be permitted.

Each Contracting State may also, when notifying an extension of the Convention in accordance with Article 17, make one or more of the said reservations, with its effect limited to all or some of the territories mentioned in the extension.

Each Contracting State may at any time withdraw a reservation it has made. Such a withdrawal shall be notified to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.

Such a reservation shall cease to have effect on the sixtieth day after the notification referred to in the preceding paragraph.


Article 19

The present Convention shall remain in force for five years from the date of its entry into force in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 15, even for States which have ratified it or acceded to it subsequently.

If there has been no denunciation, it shall be renewed tacitly every five years.

Any denunciation shall be notified to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands at least six months before the end of the five year period.

It may be limited to certain of the territories to which the Convention applies.

The denunciation will only have effect as regards the State which has notified it. The Convention shall remain in force for the other Contracting States.


Article 20

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands shall give notice to the States referred to in Article 14, and to the States which have acceded in accordance with Article 16, of the following:
a)the signatures and ratifications referred to in Article 14;

b)the date on which the present Convention enters into force in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 15;
c)the accessions referred to in Article 16 and the date on which they take effect;

d)the extensions referred to in Article 17 and the date on which they take effect;
e)the reservations and withdrawals referred to in Article 18;
f)the denunciation referred to in the third paragraph of Article 19.


In witness whereof the undersigned, being duly authorised thereto, have signed the present Convention.

Done at The Hague the 5th October 1961, in French and in English, the French text prevailing in case of divergence between the two texts, in a single copy which shall be deposited in the archives of the Government of the Netherlands, and of which a certified copy shall be sent, through the diplomatic channel, to each of the States represented at the Ninth Session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law."
