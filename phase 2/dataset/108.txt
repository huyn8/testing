CUSTOMS  TARIFFS-JULY  5,  1890	li3

ART. 2. The object of the Union is to publish, at the common expense, and to make known, as speedily and accurately as possible, the customs tariffs of the various States of the globe and the modifications that may, in future, be made in those tariffs.

ART. 3. To this end, an International Bureau shall be organized at Brus-sels, whose duty it shall be to cause these tariffs, together with such legisla-tive or executive provisions as may introduce modifications therein, to be translated and published.

ART. 4. This publication shall be made in a collection entitled: "Inter-national Customs Bulletin (organ of the International Union for the publica-tion of Customs Tariffs)." The Commercial languages most in use shall be adopted for this purpose.

ART. 5. The persons composing the International Bureau shall be ap-pointed through the agency of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belgium, which shall advance the necessary funds and see that the institution is properly managed.

ART. 6. In communications addressed by the International Bureau to the adhering Governments, the French language shall be used.

ART. 7. A report concerning the labors and the financial condition of the International Bureau shall be annually addressed to the adhering Govern-ments.

ART. 8. The annual budget of the expenditures of the International Bureau shall be fixed at the maximum of 125,000 francs.

The sum of 50,000 francs shall be placed, the first year, at the disposal of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium, to enable him to meet the expenses of the organization of the Bureau.

Such States and colonies as may hereafter avail themselves of the privilege of adhering, for which provision is made in article 14, shall pay their quotas of the said sum of 50,000 francs, on the basis of apportionment fixed in article 9.

States and colonies withdrawing from the Union at the expiration of the first term of seven years shall forfeit their rights as joint owners of the common fund.

In case of a liquidation, the common fund shall be divided among the States and colonies forming the Union on the basis of apportionment fixed by article 9.

ART. 9. With a view to the equitable adjustment of the quotas of the contracting States, those States shall be divided, according to the amount of their commerce, into six classes, the quota payable by each of which shall be in the proportion of a certain number of units, to wit:

1st class. Countries whose commerce regularly amounts to upwards of four thousand millions of francs: 55 units.

2nd class. Countries whose commerce regularly amounts to from two to four thousand millions of francs: 40 units.

174	MULTILATERAL  AGREEMENTS,	1776-1917

3d class. Countries whose commerce regularly amounts to from five hundred millions to two thousand millions of francs: 25 units.

4th class. Countries whose commerce regularly amounts to from one hundred to five hundred millions of francs: 20 units.

5th class. Countries whose commerce regularly amounts to from fifty to one hundred millions offrancs: 15 units.

6th class. Countries whose commerce regularly amounts to less than 50 millions of francs: 5 units.

ART. 10. In the case of countries whose language is not used by the Inter-national Bureau, the above figures shall be reduced two-fifths, respectively. The following reductions shall therefore be made:

The quota of the first class shall be reduced to 33 units.

The quota of the second class shall be reduced to 24 units.
The quota of the third class shall be reduced to 15 units.

The quota of the fourth class shall be reduced to 12 units.
The quota of the fifth class shall be reduced to 9 units.
The quota of the sixth class shall be reduced to 3 units.

ART. 11. The sum total of the annual expenditure, divided by the sum of the units assigned to the various contracting States, in pursuance of the foregoing provisions, shall give the unit of expenditure. This unit, multiplied by the number of units assigned to each of these States, shall show the amount of the quota payable by it for the support of the International Bureau.

ART. 12. In order to enable the Institution to edit the International Cus-toms Bulletin as accurately as possible, the contracting parties shall send it, directly and without delay, two copies:

(a)of their customs law and their customs tariff, carefully brought up to

date.

( b)  of all provisions that shall ultimately modify said law and tariff.

(c) of the circulars and instructions that shall be addressed by the said Governments to their custom-houses concerning the application of the tariff or the classification of goods, and that can be made public.

(d)of their treaties of commerce, international conventions and domestic laws having a direct bearing upon the existing tariffs.

ART. 13.

ART. 14. The States and colonies that have not yet taken part in this con-vention shall have the privilege of acceding thereto hereafter.

Notice of accession shall be given, in writing, to the Belgian Government, which shall, in tum, commmunicate such notice to all the other contracting Governments. Accession shall imply adhesion to all the clauses contained in, and the enjoyment of all advantages provided for by, this convention.

ART. 15. This convention shall go into operation on the first day of April 1891, and shall remain in force for seven years.

If, twelve months before the expiration of the first seven years, no notice of a desire for the cessation of the effects of this convention shall have been given, the Union shall continue to exist for seven years longer, and so on, in periods of seven years each.

Notice of a desire for the cessation of the effects of this convention shall be addressed to the Belgian Government. Such notice shall have no effect save as regards the country giving it, and the convention shall remain in force so far as the other countries of the Union are concerned.

The Governments shall at all times be at liberty to make in this conven-tion, by mutual agreement, such improvements as may be deemed expedient or necessary.

In testimony whereof, the undersigned have signed this Convention, and have thereunto affixed their seals.

REGULATIONS  FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE CONVENTION CREATING AN IN-TERNATIONAL BUREAU FOR THE PUBLICATION OF CUSTOMS TARIFFS

(Article  13  of the  Convention)

ARTICLE 1st. The international Customs Bulletin shall be published in five languages, with German, English,Spanish, French and Italian.

ART. 2. Each State belonging to the Union shall have the privilege of causing to be translated and publishing at its own expense, the whole or any part of the Bulletin in any language that it may see fit, provided that such language be not one of those adopted by the International Bureau.

Each of the States of the Union shall likewise have the right to reproduce mere extracts from tariffs, or, by way of exception, portions of the Bulletin, either in a local official organ or in its parliamentary documents.

It is understood moreover, that each State is to be at liberty, as has hitherto been the case, to publish all the tariffs in the original language or in a trans-lation, provided that the text published be not the work of the International Bureau.

ART. 3. The International Bureau pledges itself to take the utmost care in the translation of the customs laws and of the official publications that serve to interpret said laws, but it is understood that the Governments interested assume no responsibility with regard to the accuracy of these translations, and that, in case of dispute, the original text shall be their sole guide.

Anotice to this effect shall be printed in large type at the foot of the first page of each number.

ART. 4.  The size of the Bulletin shall be determined by the Bureau.

ART. 5. Each Government shall make known in which of the languages adopted by the International Bureau it desires to receive the copies of the Bulletin which are to be furnished to it in return for the amount payable by it for the support of the institution.

CUSTOMS  TARIFFS-JULY  5,  1890
177

Any government may take a certain number of copies in one language, and the remainder in other languages.

ART. 6. The International Bureau can supply the Bulletin to, no Govern-ments save those belonging to the Union.

ART. 7. The amount of the quota payable by each State shall be returned to it in subscriptions to the Bulletin of the Union, computed at the rate of 15
francs each.	'

ART. 8.  The expenditures are computed approximately as follows:

Francs
(a)Salaries of the offil;ers and employes of the International Bureau, including
an addition thereto of  15 per cent, " . , .. , , . , , , , , , , , , , .... , , ,

, , . , . , ,
75,000
(b)  Cost of printing and sending the  Bulletin of the Union, . , , , ,
,
, .. , ,
30, 000
(c)Rent and keeping  in  order of the  building occupied  by  the  International
Bureau,  fuel,  light,  material,  office  expenses,  etc, .. "" . "",
, . "....   20, 000
Total' ,., .. ,
,."  .'""
,
125,000

ART. 9., Itshall be the duty of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium to take such measures as may be necessary for ~he organization of the Inter-national Bureau, and for putting it in working order, keeping within the limits fixed by the Convention and by these regulations.

ART. 10. The Superintendent of the International Bureau is hereby au-thorized, subject to the approval of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bel-gium, to use, during the current fiscal year, such sums, appropriated for the past year, as may not have been then used. These sums shall, the case arising, go to form a reserve fund for the payment of contingent expenses. The said reserve shall in no case exceed 25,000 francs. The surplus will, perhaps, render it possible to reduce the price of subscription to the Bulletin, without increasing the number of copies guaranteed by the contracting States; this surplus may also serve to meet the expense that would be occasioned by the addition of a new language to those enumerated in article 1.

This last measure shall not be carried out without the unanimous consent of the States and Colonies belonging to the Union.

Done at Brussels, July the 5th, one thousand eight hundred arid ninety, to be appended to the Convention of this day's date.
