# PHASE 2 GENERAL INFORMATION & INSTRUCTIONS
The objective of phase 2 of the project is to explore machine learning and data modeling through a set of provided data.
Through extensive research and experimenting, the project has finally come to a conclusion. 

### The main program for the project is inside the phase2.py file
#### General processes for the program are listed below:
1. Raw data are selected and loaded into the python program.
2. The raw data can now be processed/cleaned.
3. Data are cleaned and ready for labeling.
4. Since the data are unstructured(unlabeled) the majority of the work is done to label and structure the data.
5. All data are now labeled and ready for future modeling if needed. The labeled data can be found in the file **computerLabel.csv**
6. A test program (test.py) was created to compare the computer-labeled data against human-labeled data. 
7. The results produced by the computer-labeled and human-labeled data were different and had little similarity.
8. Further analysis on the final results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Treiz0OLnxE3GvpXI1_XHfjGH_MR88QgZh-FmU-5Sxo/edit?usp=sharing).

#### General instructions for running the phase.py program are listed below:
1. The python program is located in the file phase2.py.
2. When running the program, make sure to comment out the "DATA CREATION" section because the data has already been created in the dataset.csv file.
3. Only run the code below the "DATA CREATION" section and wait for the output to be created.
4. It takes approximately 2-3 minutes for the final labeled data to be created. 
5. The labeled data will be created in a csv file named computerLabel.csv.
6. Additional details can be found in the comments of the code that are more specific to each part of the program. 

#### General instructions for running the test.py program are listed below:
1. The test.py program is another python program used to compare computer-labeled data and human-labeled data.
2. Run the program and a comparision will be done automatically.
3. This program is for referencing purposes only.
